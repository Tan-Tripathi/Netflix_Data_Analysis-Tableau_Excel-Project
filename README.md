# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis

#### **Project Overview:**
Netflix, as one of the leading global streaming platforms, hosts an extensive catalog of TV shows and movies. However, with the rise of competing platforms, Netflix must continually optimize its content offerings to retain its existing subscriber base and attract new viewers. This project done using **Tableau** & **Excel** analyzes the current content distribution across various aspects. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle [Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). 

The primary goal was to analyze Netflix's content catalog to uncover trends that would help Netflix refine its content production, acquisition strategy, and distribution for a broader global appeal.

#### **Tasks completed:**
A data-driven dashboard was created using Netflix's catalog dataset, encompassing 8,807 shows, both movies and TV series across 42 genres. The dataset was cleaned in Excel and visualized in Tableau for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Rating Distribution**: **TV-MA** (Mature Audience) has the largest share, indicating that Netflix’s current focus is on adult content, with **3,207 shows**. However, **family-friendly categories** such as **TV-Y, TV-G and PG** are significantly underrepresented.
3. **Shows distribution:** Movies(6,131) outnumber TV shows(2,676) with 70% being movies and 30% TV shows.
4. **Popular Genres**: The top 3 genres were **International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies**, highlighting global appeal and viewer preference for diverse content.
